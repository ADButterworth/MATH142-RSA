NOTE: When the message is printed you will see two extra characters for each new line, these are ASCII(13) which is the carrage return and ASCII(10) which is the new line feed. This does not affect the encryption process but is worth remembering if you try to decode the programs output using a ASCII table.

WARNING: The program makes no attempt to check that your provided numbers are prime, this can cause strange behaviour.

WARNING: Lowest expected pair of primes is 13 and 53, using lower values will cause an error.
